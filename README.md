# UNDER-WATER-IMAGES-ENHANCEMENT
Enhancing under water Images using various methods

Objectives- 
- To enhace underwater images for reserach purpose to explore acquatic system.
- To study various methods available for enhancing under water images.

## Methods for under Water image enhancement- 
### spatial domain techniques are
1. Blur and Sharpen filters
2. Histogram Equalisation
3. Clahe Filter
4. Laplacian Filter
5. High Boost Filter
6. Bilateral Filter
### Frequency domain techniques are 
1. Ideal Low Pass and High Pass Filters
2. Butterworth Low Pass and High Pass Filters
3. Gaussian Low Pass and High Pass Filters
4. Homomorphic Filter
5. Wavelet Transform
### Some Advanced techniques tried are
1. Denoising Filter
2. Neural Network
